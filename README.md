# Bitscore

Bitscore is a Web3 project that leverages AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to assess the credibility and trust factor of cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. The application provides users with a dashboard to explore trending coins, search for specific cryptocurrencies, and connect their wallets for portfolio management.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Displays trending coins and user-selected favorites.
- **Coin Search**: Allows users to search for specific coins (e.g., "doge") and fetch relevant data using the RAG model.
- **Trending Coins**: Lists currently trending coins based on market activity and user interest.
- **Wallet Connection**: Facilitates connection to Web3 wallets for user interaction.
- **Coin Details**: Provides detailed information about selected coins, including news, volume holders, and suspicious transactions.
